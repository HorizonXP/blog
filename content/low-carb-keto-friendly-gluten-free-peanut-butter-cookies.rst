Having lost a few pounds, I felt the desire to indulge a bit. I haven't been counting calories for the last few days, but I'm intending to start again tomorrow. Normally, I don't have room in my calorie allowances to eat keto-friendly desserts, but I decided to *indulge*. 

I've wanted to try this recipe for quite some time because I'm a sucker for peanut butter cookies. Ever since my fianc√©e (girlfriend at the time) made them for my birthday one year, I've craved them ever since. 

So for those of you with a sweet tooth, looking to splurge a bit while on a low-carb diet, this recipe's a good one. Be forewarned, you will have difficulty eating just one. It's for that reason that I won't be making them again for a while. And for the other folks that are looking for a low-:abbr:`GI (Glycemic Index)` dessert, or are allergic to gluten, this recipe's great too. Easy, fun, and oh so yummy!

Ingredients & Equipment
-----------------------

- 1 cup natural, organic chunky peanut butter
- 1 cup Splenda artificial sweetener for baking
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1 cookie/baking sheet
- Parchment paper

Directions
----------

Preheat your oven to 350 F. (Honestly, why aren't more things in metric?)

Personally, I hate volumetric measuring for cooking, but I suppose it isn't my place to buck the established trend. Anyway, measure each of those ingredients out and put them into a large mixing bowl. Mix it all together, until it turns into a cookie dough consistency.

Place parchment paper on your baking sheet, and start rolling your cookie dough and placing it on the sheet. I was able to roll 15 balls.

Take a fork and flatten each ball, creating the characteristic criss-cross pattern on the cookies. The cookies won't spread as they cook, so as long as they don't touch, you're fine.

Throw the cookies into the middle rack of your oven for 12 minutes. I used this chance to finally test the convection feature of my oven, and it worked wonderfully. If you don't have such an oven, I would recommend rotating the sheet halfway through baking.

Once they're done, they should slide off the parchment paper fairly easily. Let them cool for a while. Or eat them right away and burn your mouth like I did.
