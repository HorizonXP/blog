After nearly 2 years of riding a motorcycle, I've finally obtained my M
license! It was a bit of an ordeal, since I had not taken the Green
Goblin out of hibernation at all, even with all the gorgeous weather
we've had. I simply didn't have the time!

So on Monday morning, I took her out and gave her all of the essentials.
Fresh oil, filter, and gas, and some lube on her chain. Started her up
and she purred like a kitten. Took her for a spin in downtown Toronto,
and it felt like I was home again.

I spent an hour or so reading up on some threads over at GTAMotorcycle
(`1`_, `2`_, `3`_) and watched this `YouTube video`_. On the day of the
test, I showed up at about 10:00am, 15 minutes before my test was
supposed to start. It was a little later than I was hoping, just because
of morning traffic.

The tester inspected my bike, gave me clear instructions for what he was
expecting, and handed me the radio with the earpiece. He was very nice,
and reassured me to not be nervous. Frankly, if I remembered his name, I
would put in a good word for him.

My route differed slightly from the one shown in that video. I made a
few mistakes, but ultimately, I passed!

All in all, it was a quick and painless experience, but I'm glad I'll
never have to do it again.
